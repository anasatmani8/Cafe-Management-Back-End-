 I am excited to announce the launch of my latest project, a restaurant
    website that is designed to elevate the online ordering experience. The
    website features a sleek Angular frontend that provides an easy-to-use
    interface for customers to place orders, and a robust Spring Boot backend,
    JWT security and MySQL/Spring Data for database that ensures security and
    reliability. The website also offers an admin interface that allows
    restaurant staff to manage dishes, orders, and bills with ease. I am proud
    of this project and I can't wait for you to try it out. Don't hesitate to
    visit the website and experience the smoothness and efficiency of this new
    way of ordering food.
